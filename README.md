### Overview of the repository content

##### Supplementary tables

  - **`Table_S1.xlsx`** *Table S1.* Studies included in the literature
    review of seasonal and sex differences in preen oil chemical
    composition.
  - **`Table_S2.xslx`** *Table S2.* Occurrences (i.e., sex in each
    species or season in each species) included in the analyses of
    seasonal and sex differences in preen oil chemical composition.

##### Data and code for comparative analyses on seasonal and sex differences in preen oil composition

  - **`data_season.csv`** and **`data_sex.csv`** contain the raw data
    needed to re-run analyses.
  - **`data_phylo.nex`** contains the raw phylogenetic data obtained
    from birdtree.org.
  - **`season_analysis_Rmd.pdf`** and **`season_analysis_Rmd.Rmd`**
    contain the R code to re-run the analysis on seasonal differences.
  - **`sex_analysis_Rmd.pdf`** and **`sex_analysis_Rmd.Rmd`** contains
    the R code to re-run the analysis on sex differences.

##### Data and code for details on the studies and species included in the review and analyses

  - **`inclusion_studies_review.csv`** contains data on the review
    process and the studies included in the review (i.e. Table S1).
  - **`inclusion_species_1row1studywithinspecies.csv`** contains data on
    the occurrences (i.e., sex in each species or season in each
    species; multiple rows per species) included in the analyses
    (i.e. Table S2).
  - **`inclusion_species_1row1species.csv`** contains data on the
    species (one row per species) included in the analyses.
  - **`review_Rscript.R`** contains the R code to get all details about
    the studies and species included in the review and analyses.

##### Additional files

  - All Excel files ending with **`_description.xlsx`** contain an
    additional sheet with a detailed description of the different
    variables.
  - **`data_evolutionstudies.xlsx`** contains the data on the evolution
    of the studies on preen oil composition (i.e. Figure 1).
